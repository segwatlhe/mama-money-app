# Weather App
* The app shows the weather forcast for the city of Cape Town
* OpenWeatherMap weather API was used to get the weather forcasts

# Challenges
* The app took me approximately 3-4 days to complete up to where I could.
* Learning and understanding about OpenwatherMap was a bit tricky in the begining.
* I found reading the OpenweatherMap API tricky to read as well in the start.
* My first attempt at building the was with React. I spent 3-4 trying to build it with React. 
* Building the app in Angualar was much easier than with React, although I could see why one might pick React over Angular. It's looks easy to learn and it is fast.
